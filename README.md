# Cite My Code
A browser extension to generate BibTeX for software on GitHub. Click a button. Cite the code.

## Get Started
Cite My Code works by pulling preferred citation information from [CITATION.cff](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) files. The CITATION.cff file needs to be located in root of the repository you would like to cite. If you want to make sure Cite My Code can be used to cite your software, you will need to create a CITATION.cff for your repo.

### Installation (Chrome)
1. Clone or download the [Cite My Code repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citemycode)

2. Go to your Chrome Preferences menu, and click Extensions

You're done! Now when you navigate to a GitHub repo that contains a CITATION.cff, a green button will appear on the right side of your browser window. If you click that button, BibTeX will be generated that you can copy and paste into whatever tools you use to manage your bibliographies.
